								<h4>MEDICAL RECORD PREPARATION</h4>
								<p>
									Navigating stacks of medical records can be daunting. We
									understand. Luckily, deciphering medical records is our
									specialty! Our healthcare professionals will comb through your
									case medical records and create a succinct yet comprehensive
									timeline and chronology report. Your “blueprint” includes
									hyperlinking resources, bookmarking, OCR and bates stamping.
									Our bread and butter is identifying the gaps, and helping you
									navigate the facts as easily as possible.

								<div class="box-img-box">

								</div>
								<h4>MERIT REVIEW</h4>
								<p>
									Save time and energy with a Merit Review. Knowing whether or
									not your case has merit, based on medical facts, is critical.
									A Merit Review by an expert healthcare professional sets the
									tone for your case strategy and execution.
								</p>

								<h4>MEDICAL RESEARCH</h4>
								<p>
									Does your case need a little boost? A strong case relies on
									strong evidence. Let the nurse experts at ELNC support your
									case through evidence based research. We will do the digging
									and ensure your case strategy is supported with credible
									evidence.

								<h4>MEDICAL RECORD AUDIT</h4>
								<p>
									Identifying discrepancies within the medical chart is critical
									to your case. Whether you are a plaintiff or defendant
									attorney, understanding the patient's medical record allows
									for optimal client representation. Let the experts at ELNC
									perform an audit on your medical records with a keen clinical
									eye. Whether electronic or paper chart, maximize your
									representation with a professional medical record analysis,
									and review.

								<h4>Billing Summaries</h4>
								<p>
									It’s not a secret that healthcare has its own language. Jump
									into the throes of billing and coding, now you're in another
									sublanguage with changing dialects. (Looking at you, ICD
									codes!) ELNC will take the voyage through the medical records,
									extract the billing summary and create a succinct resource
									that is easy to navigate and decipher what remains. The
									billing summary links with the chronology report, where you
									have additional support via hyperlinking, bates stamping and a
									blueprint of what is in your records.

									Need to support your case with medical professional testimony?
									ELNC will pair you with the best medical expert witness or
									nurse subject matter expert to support your case.
